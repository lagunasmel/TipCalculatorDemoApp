## Notes

This app was built using the iPhone 8 Plus display setting. 
I had a 'split tip' feature in a previous implementation of this app, but I faced some bugs with the total amount updating properly when switching between the tip control tabs. A functioning version of the app without the split feature has been submitted instead.
